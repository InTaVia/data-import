# The InTaVia Excel Template for Local Data Import

InTaVia offers the possibility to integrate local, self-compiled data into the frontend application by import. For this purpose, we provide an Excel template whose structure is very close to the frontend data model (and thus appears somewhat complex).
**Your data remains locally in the browser's memory and is not transferred to any server.**
